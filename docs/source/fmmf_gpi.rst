Forward Model Matched Filter (FMMF) Tutorial with GPI
=====================================================
The Forward Model Matched Filter (FMMF) is an algorithm aimed at improved exo-planet detection for direct imaging.
The current implementation only works for GPI and this tutorial will explain how to use it.
A reference paper J.-B. Ruffio et al. 2016/2017 with the description of the method is currently in preparation.

.. note::
    If you ask me enough, I will try to make the code more general to work for different instruments.
